# GMTOL

## Gut Microbiome Tree of Life Project working under the guidance of Dr. Samuel Degregori to produce a comprehensive gut microbiome dataset that will allow for various analyses such as demonstrating the extent of coevolution between microbiomes and animal hosts as well as showing the effect of hosts on gut microbiome diversity and function.
## The final goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of the animal gut microbiome.
